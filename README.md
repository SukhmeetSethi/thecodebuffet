# thecodebuffet

thecodebuffet is nothing special when it is comapred to the knowledge wealth available on Google with but it's an attempt to learn and share our bit of knowledge and experience gained while working with IT Industry. 

The idea is to share "how we did this" or "how we worked on this technology" rather than how it should be done. 

This is just the microsite code, you can find the website here: [thecodebuffet](https://thecodebuffet.com)
