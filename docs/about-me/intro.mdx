# Nice Meeting you!

 I am **Sukhmeet Sethi**  and here's how you can find me in a crowded market :

export const ProfileImage = ({ imageUrl, color }) => (
  
    <div  style={{display: "flex", width : "80%" , alignItems: "center" , padding: "2rem", margin : "10px" }} >
     
        <img src={imageUrl}  style={{borderRadius: "40%" , width: "50%" }}/>
     
    </div>
  
);

<ProfileImage color="#2583c2" imageUrl="/img/sukhmeet.jpg" />{" "}

## Introduction

I have been working with IT industry over years. Started as developer, progressed as Architect and currently working as a Technology leader in a well reputed organization.
Though I have played many roles during my career apart from developer like Tech Lead, Delivery Lead, Solution Architect, Product Head and DevOps Lead but I have always been developer at heart and I still feel the same.

At this point of my career, I try to feel that I am technology agnostic software engineer but honestly I have a big bend towards Java. It has been my primary programming language since the beginning of my career. Good thing is I am not restricted to Java any more but have been working with lot Cloud related technologies, NoSQLs, Big Data as well as DevOps.
I am also big fan of highly scalable and highly available architectures with optimized continuous integration platform for faster time to market and comprehensive Observability to ensure easy maintainance.

## Why theCodeBuffet

Well there is no particular reason, it is just my attempt to stay close to technology. As my professional role is increasing with many non-technical responsibilities, I wanted to make sure I stay connect with my hands-on skills and also share my experiences and whatever little knowledge I have with others. 
Honestly, I have been thinking to start something like that since long but my pathetic UI skills have always been a roadblock. So this time I thought, let's just use any microsite framework and get something going and may be I will keep improving as I learn more. And I found a very apt framework in the form of
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It's easy to create content with markdown support and also do some flashy stuff if you know react.

Hoping that I can continue this effort with the same energy with which I have started it and it doesn't fizzles out over time like it happens for many out of job initatives. Also looking for your continous support and feedback.
